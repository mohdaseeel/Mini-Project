# Hand Landmark Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates hand landmark detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It identifies key points on the hand, such as joints and fingertips, in real-time through a webcam or video input. The application can be utilized in gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, or other interactive systems.

Features:

-Detects and tracks 21 hand landmarks in real-time.<br>
-Easy-to-use interface for testing and visualization.<br>
-Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.<br>

How to Use:<br>
-Clone the repository.<br>
-Install dependencies from the requirements.txt.<br>
-Run the Python script to start the real-time detection.<br>
 
This project is a practical implementation for beginners exploring computer vision and hand gesture recognition systems.
