# Hand Landmark Detection Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates hand landmark detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It identifies key points on the hand, such as joints and fingertips, in real-time through a webcam or video input. The application can be utilized in gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, or other interactive systems.

Features:
Detects and tracks 21 hand landmarks in real-time.
Easy-to-use interface for testing and visualization.
Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies from the requirements.txt.
Run the Python script to start the real-time detection.
This project is a practical implementation for beginners exploring computer vision and hand gesture recognition systems.
